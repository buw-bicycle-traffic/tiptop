# TiptoP Cycling Experiment
Cycling data collected in the field and simulator experiments during the **TiptoP** (Technical and planning solutions to topographical problems in bicycle traffic) project.
The **TiptoP** project conducted experiments to examine the impact of topography on bicycling behavior, combining real-world field studies and advanced simulator trials.

Real-world Field Experiment
---
The field experiment involved **35 participants** navigating a **3.2 km loop** on the Grifflenberg campus in Wuppertal, featuring up to **13% slopes**. Equipped with bicycling sensors, participants' **speed, cadence, power output, GPS data, and heart rate** were recorded. 
This real-world setting provided a comprehensive look at how cyclists adapt their behavior to varying gradients and environmental conditions.

Bicycle Simulator Experiment
---
In parallel, a **simulator experiment** recreated similar conditions in a controlled environment. 
Using a custom-built setup with a **Wahoo** smart trainer and virtual reality software, another group of participants encountered different routes and slopes as in reality. 
The simulator experiment involved **31 participants**.
This approach allowed precise manipulation of terrain and testing scenarios beyond what is feasible in the field. Similar to the field experiment, participants' **speed, cadence, power output, GPS data, and heart rate** were recorded.
The simulator data also enabled validation against real-world results, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
