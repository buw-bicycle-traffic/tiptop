The **TiptoP** project conducted experiments to examine the impact of topography on bicycling behavior, combining real-world field studies and advanced simulator trials. 
The field experiments involved **35 participants** navigating a **3.2 km loop** on the Grifflenberg campus in Wuppertal, featuring up to **13% slopes**. Equipped with bicycling sensors, participants' **speed, cadence, power output, GPS data, and heart rate** were recorded. 
This real-world setting provided a comprehensive look at how cyclists adapt their behavior to varying gradients and environmental conditions.

In parallel, a **simulator experiment** recreated similar conditions in a controlled environment. 
Using a custom-built setup with a **Wahoo** smart trainer and virtual reality software, another group of participants encountered different routes and slopes as in reality. 
This approach allowed precise manipulation of terrain and testing scenarios beyond what is feasible in the field. Similar to the field experiment, participants' **speed, cadence, power output, GPS data, and heart rate** were recorded.
The simulator data also enabled validation against real-world results, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
