# TiptoP Bicycling Data
Bicycling data collected during the real-world and simulator bicycling experiments in the TiptoP Project. 

TiptoP - Technical and planning solutions to topographical problems in bicycle traffic

The TiptoP project conducted experiments to examine the impact of topography on bicycling behavior, combining real-world field studies and advanced simulator trials. 
The field experiments involved 35 participants navigating a 3.2 km loop on the Grifflenberg campus in Wuppertal, featuring up to 13% slopes. Equipped with bicycling sensors, participants' speed, cadence, power output, GPS data, and heart rate were recorded. 
This real-world setting provided a comprehensive look at how cyclists adapt their behavior to varying gradients and environmental conditions.

In parallel, a simulator experiment recreated similar conditions in a controlled environment. 
Using a custom-built setup with Wahoo smart trainer and virtual reality software, another group of participants encountered different routes and slopes as in reality. 
This approach allowed precise manipulation of terrain and testing scenarios beyond what is feasible in the field. 
The simulator data also enabled validation against real-world results, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
